# food-list-api
Project created to improve my skills using Java and Spring Boot framework. I also used swagger, HIBERNATE/JPA, MySQL and others less important.

WHY YOU HAVE TO USE THIS API?
 - you can register dishes, food and ingredients in the database, it will be worth for you if you want to save rotines and categorize ideas
 - you can see other people registers, if they put them public!
 - you can post recipes and find recipes of others.
 
I WANNNA USE THIS, HOW I DO THAT?
  - there are some routes to register and find this components  


  DISH ROUTES  
  
    - localhost:8080/dish/id
      - use this route to put delete find or post one dish, you can find more than one just omiting the last part "/id"
